moc 
=== - mini but extensiable online communication system,
      we use it on our small game mobile app.
      most code stolen from nmdb, clearsilver... thanks them a lot.


design
------
    Based on nmdb, one server can hold multi backend module
    (per module, one plugin, one message queue, one thread);

    And, one module can exist on many process or many servers
    for load share.

    consider doc/net-skeleton.png and the codes for more information.


directory
---------
    moc/
    |-- server             server daemon code (only tested on GNU/Linux)
    |-- plugin             server application logic module code
    |-- client             client API code (tested on Linux, ios, android)
    |   `-- clearsilver    client API depend on clearsilver's util library
    |-- conf               configration file
    |-- demo               simple application demo(use client API)
    `-- doc                documentation



depend
------
    The server depend on cmoon's mnl library currently. so, checkout
    git://github.com/bigml/cmoon.git into the moc's parent directory.
    and do the rest lib/mnl's compile fuck, then, every thing goes ok.

    Client is very easy to compile, gcc, xcode, ndk can compile client
    directory to a static library.
    Take a look on client/Makefile first, you need to manually define
    some macros like EVENTLOOP, std=c99... on non-Linux enviorment.

    And then, compile the chat demo, modify mocclient.hdf config file,
    run it, hack it, have fun!
